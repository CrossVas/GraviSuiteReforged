# GraviSuite Reforged for Minecraft 1.5.2

This is an attempt to reforge the old-classic IC2 addon - GraviSuite, using [voldeloom](https://github.com/CrackedPolishedBlackstoneBricksMC/voldeloom) as foundation. 


It has all the features of the original + some new features like:
- Advanced Iridium Drill with switchable silk/fortune enchantments and a vein miner ability (can't be disabled);
- Electro Magnet;
- Vajra now has switchable silk/fortune modes AND vein miners (for ores and ANY blocks);
- clean code written from scratch (I hope).

I don't own the idea. Full credit for the idea goes to [SeNtiMeL](https://forum.industrial-craft.net/thread/6915-ic2-exp-1-7-10-gravitation-suite-v2-0-3/) and IC2 Dev team.
